# Interactive t-SNE Plots Repository

## Overview

This repository hosts interactive t-SNE plots created using Bokeh and HoloViews. These plots are specifically designed for embedding into PowerPoint presentations through the Microsoft Web Viewer add-on. The goal is to provide URLs for each plot hosted on GitLab Pages, enabling easy integration into PowerPoint slides. This approach currently serves as the sole viable solution for incorporating interactive plots into PowerPoint presentations.

## Repository Contents

- **Interactive Plots**: A collection of HTML files, each representing an interactive t-SNE plot for detailed visualization of complex datasets.

## Usage Instructions

### Embedding Plots into PowerPoint

1. **Select a Plot**: Choose the desired HTML file from the repository for the plot you wish to embed in your presentation.

2. **Obtain the Plot URL**:
   - Each plot is hosted on GitLab Pages.
   - When you select an HTML file in this repository, you will be redirected to the GitLab Page hosting the plot.
   - Copy the URL of this page.

3. **Embed in PowerPoint**:
   - Open your PowerPoint presentation.
   - Go to the slide where you want the plot.
   - If not already installed, add the Microsoft Web Viewer to your PowerPoint.
   - Use the Web Viewer to embed the plot using the URL you copied.

4. **Interact with the Plot**: The embedded plot in PowerPoint will remain fully interactive, just as in a web browser.

## Repository Size Considerations

The repository aims to stay under 1GB to ensure smooth operation and manageability. This limit accommodates approximately 100 interactive plots. Periodic updates may be necessary to adhere to this size constraint.

## Purpose

The need for this repository arises from the challenge of incorporating interactive data visualizations into PowerPoint presentations. As directly embedding interactive plots in PowerPoint is not straightforward, this repository provides a workable solution through GitLab Pages and the Microsoft Web Viewer add-on.
